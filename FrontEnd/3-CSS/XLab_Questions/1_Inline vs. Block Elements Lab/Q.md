Inline vs. Block Elements Lab
In this lab, you will work on understanding the difference between inline and block elements in HTML & CSS. Different HTML elements have different default display properties. Inline elements take up only as much width as necessary and do not force a new line, while block elements take up the full width and begin on a new line.

This lab will guide you through the concepts of inline and block elements, their properties, and how to change the display type using CSS.

By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of inline and block elements and be able to work with them effectively to design beautiful and functional web pages.

You can add proper background-color to the elements to find out how much space each element takes
