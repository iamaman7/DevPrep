Flexbox Flex Flow Lab
In this lab, you will be practicing flex-flow property in CSS. The flex-flow property is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties. It allows you to control the direction in which the flex items should be laid out and whether they should wrap or not. We will create an HTML structure with a container and flex items. You will apply different flex-flow values to have a better understanding of this property and how it works with various combinations. You will write the CSS code and we will then evaluate your code based on the challenges given.

You will learn:

What is flex-flow property.
How to use flex-flow to control direction and wrapping of flex items.
Various combinations of flex-direction and flex-wrap to achieve the desired layout.

-------------------------------------------------------
Set the display property to flex for the container - Add the display property to the container with a value of flex.

Set the flex-direction and flex-wrap to default values - Set the flex-flow property to 'row nowrap' for the container.

Change flex-flow to 'column wrap' in a duplicate container - Duplicate the container div with the class 'container' and add an additional class 'column-wrap'. Update the flex-flow property of this new container to 'column wrap'.

Change flex-flow to 'row-reverse wrap-reverse' in another duplicate container - Duplicate the container div with the class 'container' and add an additional class 'row-reverse-wrap-reverse'. Change the flex-flow property of this new container to have 'row-reverse wrap-reverse' values.
