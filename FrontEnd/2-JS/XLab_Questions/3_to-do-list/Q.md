Simple To-Do List App
In this lab, you'll build a simple To-Do List App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app will consist of an input field to add new tasks, a list to display the tasks, and a button to clear all tasks. The focus of the lab will be on using event listeners, DOM manipulation, and HTML/CSS styling.

To complete the lab, you'll need to understand the following concepts:

Basic HTML/CSS to create the layout of the app.
JavaScript event handling (e.g., click event).
DOM manipulation to dynamically add, edit and remove elements in the list.
Using local storage to persist the list data across browser sessions (optional).
-----------------------------------------
Add a new task to the list - When the "Add Task" button is clicked, a new task should be created using the input value and added to the task list. Each task should be a list item with a class name "task-item".

Remove a task from the list - When a task item is clicked, it should be removed from the task list.

Clear all tasks from the list - When the "Clear All Tasks" button is clicked, all tasks should be removed from the task list.
